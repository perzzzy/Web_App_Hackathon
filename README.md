Welcome to **THERMOSECURITY**! This project was developed during the Housecom Hackathon and is a remake of a school assignment. The goal was to create an interactive application that offers an engaging user experience through the use of 3D and still images. This project is designed as a mobile-first, one-page web application. The content is original to the school project and has not been altered or supplemented with additional material.
